IT professional with multiple years of experience as software developer and consultant. Over the years I became passionate about solving problems and automate processes with software. I favor an agile environment which fosters fast paced iterations leveraging DevOps practices.

For me, transparent, trust-building communication is a key factor, when it comes to aligning people. Trust is what it takes for colleagues to join forces focusing on a common goal.

I like to describe myself as an open-minded person, honest and a team player and always keen to learn new things and make new experiences. 

I am a Java guy, I like Kotlin. I can build a webapp with React or Vue.js, but I am really not good at CSS. ðŸ¥´

The next thing I would like to checkout is Flutter.
