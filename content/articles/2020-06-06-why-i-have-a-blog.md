There are already so many blogs out there, most of them have probably more and better content than mine. Yet I have decided to start running my own blog. So why?

Over the years as a software professional working on different projects and with different people, I naturally started to collect some experiences. I began to formulate opinions in my head, but I rarely formally express them. So, I have decided that I want to start writing down some of my opinions, really more as a reference for myself. I want to practise to summarise and verbalize my thougths. It has been quite some time since I wrote my thesis, so I want to get back in shape. Why would I not do this publically?

I hope that a good part of my writing will be about software design and implementation. Small examples from the field, but also about little experiments I am doing on the side. Possibly there will be some posts about teamwork and collaboration. Some of it may well be worth sharing. So putting my words in the internet seems like one way of doing it.

Further, running this blog gives me a chance to try out new things and technologies. For example Vue.js with Nuxt.js and the content module, which I used to create this blog. Let's see if I learn something about SEO. Will this blog show up on Google? ðŸ¤”

Last, but not least I would like to get some feedback and maybe engage in some discussions related to a post that I am publishing. For that aspect I am planing to also publish my posts on platforms like for example [DEV](https://dev.to/). This gives me some additional outreach and it has a nice comment/discussion feature.

So, let's see.
